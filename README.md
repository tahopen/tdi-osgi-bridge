# pdi-osgi-bridge

This project builds a PDI plugin which supplies extensions to the PluginRegistry allowing OSGI bundles to supply Kettle plugin types. 


### Development
Development of this project is active under the "future-develop" branch. This branch will contain the source of the latest released version once available.

#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 11
* This [settings.xml](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/blob/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

__Build for nightly/release__

All required profiles are activated by the presence of a property named "release".

```
$ mvn clean install -Drelease
```

This will build, unit test, and package the whole project (all of the sub-modules). The artifact will be generated in: ```activator/target```

__Build for CI/dev__

The `release` builds will compile the source for production (meaning potential obfuscation and/or uglification). To build without that happening, just eliminate the `release` property.

```
$ mvn clean install
```

#### Running the tests

__Unit tests__

This will run all tests in the project (and sub-modules).
```
$ mvn test
```

If you want to remote debug a single java unit test (default port is 5005):
```
$ cd core
$ mvn test -Dtest=<<YourTest>> -Dmaven.surefire.debug
